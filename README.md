# Functional_traits
A repository for analysis of functional traits data from natural and restoring mangrove and saltmarsh sites in Eastern Australia.

To run the saltmarsh or mangrove code, run all chunks sequentially in the "Set up" section, then navigate to whatever trait you are interested in and run the chunks in that section sequentially.
